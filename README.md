The Flight Deal Finder is a program that allows users to set a list of destinations for which they want to purchase airplane tickets, along with a minimum price threshold. Once the preferences are set, the program connects to relevant APIs to retrieve ticket prices for the specified destinations, sending an SMS with the requested information.
